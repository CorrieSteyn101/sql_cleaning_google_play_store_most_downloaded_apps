# Google Play Store Analytics

This is my first comprehensive end-to-end data analytics project that explores the the most downloaded apps on Google Play Store.

The project covers the full analytics workflow — where I used SQL to clean up my dataset and built an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

The dataset contained inconsistent date formats, text-based numeric values, encoding issues, and missing values.

## 📊 Project Workflow:

### 1. Data Cleaning (in SQL):
Created, cleaned and structured a master dataset using SQL.

### 2. Final Dataset Columns:
App Name
Developer
Downloads
Category
Date Published
Date Reached
Pre Installed
Price
Type (Free/Paid)

### 3. Dashboard Building (in Power BI):
Designing and building a dashboard on Google Play Store's most downloaded apps to visualize patterns and draw insights.
